This scripts are for learning purpose.
Many of the scripts may not follow some standard rules of lenguage,
since am not an expert on python.

*******************************
sort.py -> this script can be placed in folder with many files and will organize them placing
            them in a folder with other files with the same extension.
            EX: test.exe , lol.exe -> will be place folder called "exe"
           
define.py -> Easy way to get definition through CLI using Dictionary.com definitions.

sync.py -> Smart way to copy files. Will copy the files and folders missing, ignore all the files that are currently in the folder. there is 2 modes "-s" and "-d"(explanation inside the script file)

clog.py -> this small class will make it easier to add color to projects. when imported look at the function clog.test() for examples on how to use it. This project is not completed and has room for improvement
