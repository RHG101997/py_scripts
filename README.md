sort.py -> this script can be placed in folder with many files and will organize them placing
            them in a folder with other files with the same extension.
            EX: test.exe , lol.exe -> will be place folder called "exe"
           
define.py -> Easy way to get definition through CLI using Dictionary.com definitions.

sync.py -> Smart way to copy files. Will copy the files and folders missing, ignore all the files that are currently in the folder. there is 2 modes "-s" and "-d"(explanation inside the script file)
